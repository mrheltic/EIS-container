# CNN Image Classification with Keras and TensorFlow

This project aims to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using Keras and TensorFlow. The CNN model will be deployed within a Docker container for easy deployment and scalability.

## CNN Architecture

The CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers to extract meaningful features from the input images. These features are then passed through fully connected layers to perform classification. The model will be trained using a labeled dataset to learn the patterns and characteristics of different image classes.

## Docker Setup

To containerize the CNN model, we will use Docker. The Dockerfile provided in this repository contains the necessary instructions to build the Docker image. It includes the installation of required dependencies such as Keras, TensorFlow, and any additional libraries needed for image processing, you just need to run the command to build the container and then run it.

## Usage

To use this CNN image classification model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that Docker is installed and running.
3. Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile.
4. Once the image is built, run a Docker container using the created image.
5. Access the container and execute the necessary commands to train or test the CNN model.

## Dataset

For training and testing the CNN model, a labeled dataset of images is required and you can start using the CIFAR-10 (tested with 71% accuracy) or the CIFAR-100 (tested with 35% accuracy). It is recommended to use a dataset that is relevant to the desired image classification task. Ensure that the dataset is properly preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.

## Conclusion

By utilizing the power of CNNs, Keras, TensorFlow, and Docker, this project provides a scalable and efficient solution for image classification tasks. Feel free to customize the CNN or Docker architecture, experiment with different datasets, and explore various hyperparameters to achieve optimal results.
